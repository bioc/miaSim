Title: Microbiome Data Simulation
Description:
    Microbiome time series simulation with generalized Lotka-Volterra model,
    Self-Organized Instability (SOI), and other models. Hubbell's Neutral model
    is used to determine the abundance matrix. The resulting abundance matrix
    is applied to (Tree)SummarizedExperiment objects.
